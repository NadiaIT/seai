# Teamwork - A Primer 

Christian Kaestner


----

## Group Project

* 4 Milestones and a Final Presentation
* Milestone 1: Build movie recommendation service (2 weeks)
* Milestone 2: Model and infrastructure quality (2 weeks)
* Milestone 3: Monitoring and continuous deployment (2 weeks)
* Milestone 4: Drift and feedback loops (1 week)
* Groups of 4--6 students

----
## Infrastructure

* We simulate 1M users on a platform with 160k movies
* We provide an underpowered virtual machine
* You can observe the system through logs streamed in Apache Kafka
* We send recommendation requests to your VM
* Technology choices entirely up to you
* You may use additional resources (e.g. AWS)
*
* Focus on reliable deployment; we do not care about accuracy

----
## Step 1: Establish Communication and Meeting Patterns

* Agree on how to communicate in the team: Email? Slack? Whatsapp?
* Agree on communication expectation. Different people have different habits and expectations. Be explicit!
    * Read emails daily? On weekends?
    * Respond to urgent chat messages within 3h?
    * Be available for chat during certain hours?
+ Find meeting times: one early, one or two in the middle, one late? Extra meetings as needed?
+ Write down expectations!

+ Set realistic expectations:  All have other classes and distractions; communicate availability openly

----
## Team Citizenship

* Not everybody will contribute equally to every assignment -- that's okay
* But be good team citizen!
* 
* Be responsive and responsible
* Stick to commitments, work on assigned tasks
* When problems, reach out, replan, communicate early, be proactive
* Come to meetings on time


----
## Team Member Evaluation Form

* Has the student attended team meetings? 
* Has the student made a serious effort at assigned work before the team meetings? 
* Has the student notified a teammate if they would not be able to attend a meeting or fulfill a responsibility? 
* Does the student attempt to make contributions in group meetings? 
* Does the student listen to their teammatesâ€™ ideas and opinions respectfully and give them careful consideration? 
* Does the student cooperate with the group effort?

*(not asking for amount or quality of work completed)*

----
## Team Composition and Roles

* Team members have different strength and weaknesses -- that's good
* Make use of individual strength of team members
  * Split responsibilities and work, ....
  * Onboard, pair up, ...
* Consider assigning and rotating roles and responsibilities
    - E.g., coordinator (host), moderator, and scribe for team meetings, submitter responsible for final checks and submission of milestone
* See GitHub for example [team policy](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/F2020/other_material/team%20policy.pdf)

----
## Step 2: Dividing the Work

* Coordinate at meetings
* Read assignment before meeting
* Discuss big picture and how to divide work (inner teams?)
* Consider task dependencies
* 
* **Write down explicit deliverables**
    - *Who* does *what* by *when* 
    - Be explicit about expected results, should be verifiable 
    - Track completion, check off when done
    - GitHub issues, Trello board, Google docs, ... -- **single source of truth, with history tracking**
* Complete deliverable list **during meeting**: everybody writes their own deliverables, others read all deliverables to check understanding
    - if not completed during meeting or team member not at meeting, email assignment after meeting to everybody; no objection within 24h counts as agreement with task assignment

----
## Common Sources of Conflict

* Different team members have different working patterns and communication preferences
    - e.g., start early vs close to deadline
    - e.g., plan ahead vs try and error
    - e.g., react to every notification vs reduce distractions and read email once a day
    - *discuss and set explicit expectations; talk about conflicts*
* Different abilities, unexpected difficulties
    - work in pairs, plan time for rework and integration
    - replan, contribute to teams in different ways
    - *work around it, it's the team's responsibility*
* Unreliable team members, poor team citizenship
    - e.g., not starting the work in agreed time, not responding, not attending meetings
    - have written clear deliverables with deadlines
    - *talk about it within team, talk to course staff, peer grading*

----
## Meeting Tips

* Regular 1h meeting, assign moderator who keeps time
* Longer work/integration meeting with needed team members as needed
* If using zoom: Use video, muting often not needed in small groups
* Use Slack/chat deliberately
    - consider chat ephemeral, don't expect everybody to catch up on all old messages
    - explicitly tag people if you need their input
    - separate social communication from work communication, urgent from not urgent
    - discuss non-urgent, long-term things outside of chat associated with topic (issue tracker, Google doc, ...)
* Reserve time to reflect on teamwork and discuss possible improvements on communication and process
* Reserve time for socializing and celebrating success

----
## Explore Collaborative Tools

Examples:
* GitHub issue tracker: async topical discussions and todo list
* Google docs: collaborative report editing
* GitHub wiki or markdown files: design and documentation 
* AWS Cloud9, Google Colab, and similar: online IDE and pair programming
* Slack: informal communication and pinging people for immediate questions
* Zoom: planned and ad-hoc meetings

----
## Now: First Team Meeting

* Sending teams into breakout rooms
* Say hi, introduce yourself
    - Name? SE or ML background? Location and time zone? Favorite movie? Fun fact?
    - Find time for first team meeting in next few days (remote/in person?)
    - Agree on primary communication until team meeting
    - Pick a movie-related team name
    - Fill out slide for your team: ...
* No fixed end. Close zoom when done. Feel free to hang out. See you next week.
